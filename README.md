# Lab_5

## Description
In this lab, you implement a simple card game. We represent a deck of 52 cards comprising 13 ranks in each of the four suits: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades. Each suit includes an Ace, a two, a three, a four, a five, a six, a seven, an eight, a nine, a ten, a Jack, a Queen, and a King. You will create a simple game with two computer players. There are five cards in each hand and the player with more Ace cards is the winner. In case of a tie, when both players have the same number of Ace cards, the deck is created anew, the deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a new hand. All of this functionality will be implemented using Python classes.
